- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @atulvinod, a nerdy and passionate software enginner from India. This github profile is to document my latest things i am tinkering with, some for fun, 
- some to learn and some to figure out how to do something what my boss told me to do :P.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly into full-stack development, mostly using Angular and .NET, but i am always doing new things and messing around with things.
- ðŸ“« You can ping me at atulvinod1911@gmail.com!
